  <p style="font-family:arial;color:#301D0F"> This agent-based model was created as part of the University of Leeds module "Programming 
    for Social Scientists". <br>
    It simulates a number of agents moving around and consuming 
    resources from their environment. The agents move around more quickly if they have fewer resources in their stores 
    and they also share their resources with other nearby agents. <br>
    The model produces an animation of the agents eating the environment, and can be run from the command line. </p>
    <p style="font-family:arial;color:#301D0F"> To run the model: </p>
    <ul style="font-family:arial;color:#301D0F">
      <li>Download the relevant files using the link below.</li>
      <li>Open the Command Prompt / Terminal.</li>
      <li>Set the directory to the place where you have saved the model files.</li>
      <li>Type into the Command Prompt / Terminal: "python animationmodel.py 10 100 20" and press Enter.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p style="font-family:arial;color:#301D0F">
    The three numbers represent, in order, the number of agents, the number of iterations, and the size of the neighbourhood 
    (for interacting with nearby agents). You can re-run the model with different parameters by simply typing in different 
    numbers. </p>
