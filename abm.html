   <hr />
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> These agent-based models simulate a number of agents moving around and consuming 
    resources from their environment. The agents move around more quickly if they have fewer resources in their stores 
    and they also share their resources with other nearby agents. The first model produces an animation of the model 
    while the second model is one which can be run from the command line. This can be run by simply typing "python model.py 
  10 100 20" into the command prompt after setting the appropriate directory. The three numbers represent, in order, the 
    number of agents, the number of iterations, and the size of the neighbourhood (for interacting with nearby agents).
  This makes it simple to run the model multiple times while changing the parameters to any number the user specifies.</p>
